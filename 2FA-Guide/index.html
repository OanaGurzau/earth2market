        <p>Use Transferwise. It's simple, fees are low, and you won't lose money in the process. Wire transfers take a chain of banks and are not a good option, in my experience. </p>
        <p>Set up a Transferwise account and verify it by first depositing 20 dollars, which you will be able to get back, on it (in the USD account that you should create) and then, always on TW in the verifying section, sending a picture of both sides of a document of your choice, along with a selfie where you are portrayed next to the visible document (the whole process, with a phone camera and a computer, does not take more than 10 minutes, and it's a one time thing). Then in TW set a recipient account with your real bank account you need your money sent to. </p>
        <p>The details you need to send are shown in the picture, of course the address needed is both yours and Trasnferwise's.</p>
        <p>Choose to send the details of the USD ACCOUNT ("Inside the US" option, those are the right details) on Transferwise to credits@earth2.io (use the same email you signed up as a player with on E2), you can see them by just clicking on the USD account you should have created.</p>
        <p>When the money reaches your USD TW account, if you do not use USD in your country or bank account, CONVERT the USD just arrived into the currency you want them in INSIDE TW's site. Then, you will have them in that currency's account. ONLY THEN:</p>
        <p>Send the money to your bank account in that specific currency, which means no huge fees, and money getting there fast.</p>
