      <h3>Benefits of becoming a sniper</h3>
      <br>
      <h4>☞ Join a private, close community</h4>
      <p>When we talk about our close community, we refer to a solid, tight community, a safe space for our snipers to share ideas or their latest finds. We thrive to keep our discord spam and drama-free where snipers can communicate with one another in their own safe space. This is why our discord has dedicated channels for our premium members only, where they can ask questions, share tips and tricks or simply crack a joke with the rest of the community. This way, we manage to avoid member cluttering and never-ending pointless chats other discord channels might have. </p>
      <br>
      <h4>☞ Improve your Earth2 market browsing experience</h4>
      <p>Our earth2.market community project along with the premium.earth2.market project wishes to serve as add-ons to the main, official earth2.io marketplace. Our fan-made project, premium.earth2.market, uses smart synchronization which reduces the load on earth2.io servers. We value our users, so our projects are focused on being user-friendly and easy on the eyes, having special filters that help you find exactly what you are looking for in less time than actually browsing countries one by one in the official marketplace. </p>
      <br>
      <h4>☞ Snipe great deals faster</h4>
      <p>Unlike our regular earth2.market community project, our snipers premium services refreshes more frequently with our databases and display properties matching your filters in a structured, tabular way, giving you the ability to find discounted offers that you rarely see in the official marketplace. More than that, in our future updates, we will have a notification system in place so you can make sure you don't lose any deals you are interested in.</p>

      <br>
      <h4>☞ We value your privacy. We will never store any of your info on our servers!</h4>
      <p>Our aim is to offer you a risk-free service. We do not have any login system on our site, and we will never ask for any information from you. Access to our site is made through a unique private token, given to you upon subscription. </p>

      <h1 style="text-align: center">Tiers and Prices</h1>
      <hr>
    </br>
      <p>We currently have 4 tiers subscriptions in place. Each tier is unique on its own and it comes with its own advantages. We made sure to create a balance between the tiers so sniping will be fair for everyone, no matter the tier they choose.
      </p>
    </br>
      <h4>
        Prices and Tiers Comparison 
      </h4>
      
      <p>      Based on our experience, users pick Tier 1 (Shotgun) or Tier 2 (Sniper) because of its ability to refresh more than the regular earth2.market. This can be very convenient if you want to have more market updates for the countries you want to flip with, but you don't necessarily have the time or the desire to get into serious sniping.</p>

      <p>Tier 3 (Ninja) and Tier 4 (Lighting) on the other hand, are dedicated for those users who want to take their sniping one step further. Serious snipers will enjoy these two tiers because of its automatic refresh of every 3 or 2 seconds. Both tiers gives you access to two different tokens, so you have the ability of using two devices at the same time or share the cost of your chosen tier with your friend.</p>

      <h1 style="text-align: center">Sniping Best Practices</h1>
      <hr>
    </br>
      <p>When it comes to sniping, filters are your best friend. Our premium service tries to make your search easier, by gathering only the best properties from the official earth2.io servers using smart synchronization that has the role of reducing the load on the official servers. We filter these properties and we return only the relevant results based on the filters you choose. The properties refresh happens dynamically, so you don't have to keep refreshing the page in order to see the latest deals.</p>
      <p>There are no go-to filters when it comes to sniping. Just like in real life, on earth2 we deal with a dynamic marketplace, so the prices can fluctuate from one day to another.</p>
      <p>However, we will present a use-case scenario that you can use as a boilerplate and adjust it to your needs later on.</p>
      <p>The first thing you need to do is to have a look at the official earth2 marketplace to get an idea on what the prices look like for different classes and different countries.</p>
      <p>Upon closer inspection, we notice that on Class 1 countries with a maximum $2 per tile, we rarely see any discounts close to -40%. So let's use the filters we have on the premium market and Choose Class 1, a minimum discount of 40%, a maximum per tile of $2 and just because we don't want to spend much, a minimum price of $5 and a maximum price of $50. After a few seconds and we instantly see two offers that look very promising. We can click on "Buy Now" button and we will be taken straight to the property on the official earth2.io so we can buy them.</p>

    
   


      <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="imgs/denmark-SriLanka.png" alt="class 1 earth2 premium marketplace" style="width: 90%">
      </p>

      <p>For the sake of this example, let's have a closer look at them first:</p>
      <p>And yes, the Sri Lanka property is placed at a discount of -51% off, while the next cheaper property is placed at -26.13%. This property would be great for a few extra $.</p>

      <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="imgs/sriLanka.png" alt="class 1 50 off sri lanka" style="width: 90%">
      </p>

      <p>Let's look in Denmark as well. While the discount is not that high, the property is not expensive at all, compared to the ones next to it so it may bring us a few $ as well. </p>

      <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="imgs/denmark.png" alt="class 1 44 off denmark" style="width: 90%">
      </p>

      <p>Of course, in a real case scenario, you won't have time to browse the earth2 official marketplace to compare the prices like we did here. Our snipers already have an idea of what prices there are in each country so the great deals don't stay up on the market for too long. Remember, you always have the option to hide properties that don't interest you so you can always focus on the new added deals. </p>
